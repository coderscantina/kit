 * One cell. `label` is the column's name, repeated for the stacked layout a
 * phone gets: there the header row is off screen, so the cell has to say what
 * it is. It is real text rather than generated content, and it is hidden the
 * screen-reader way rather than removed, so a phone still announces it while
 * the record stays one line of values wide.
 *
 * The name is also written to `data-label`, which is what the stacked layout
 * tells a record's secondary fields from its subject and its actions by.
